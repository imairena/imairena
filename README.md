# Hi there, I'm Ian Mairena Jarquin 👋

I am an **Applied Mathematics** student at the **University of Waterloo** with a minor in **Computing**. I am driven by the potential for **AI** and software to transform early cancer detection and improve patient outcomes.

### 📈 Current Focus
* 🔭 **Foundations of AI:** Mastering the mathematical and computational foundations of Artificial Intelligence through targeted coursework and personal projects.
* 🚀 **Data Science Portfolio:** Building a comprehensive portfolio of Machine Learning and data analytics projects to bridge the gap between mathematics and software solutions.
* 💡 **AI for Medicine:** Applying Machine Learning techniques to medical datasets with the long-term goal of advancing early cancer diagnosis and clinical outcomes.

### 🚀 Featured Projects
* **[Global Tech Layoffs: End-to-End Data Pipeline](https://github.com/imairena/cleaning-world-layoffs-data):** Developed a **MySQL** pipeline using Window Functions and CTEs to remove 1,300+ duplicates and standardized data for time-series analysis. Visualized trends using an interactive **Tableau** dashboard.
* **[Heart Disease Explorer](https://github.com/imairena/heart-disease-explorer):** Built a **Streamlit** dashboard in **Python** to analyze UCI medical data. Implemented a custom centroid-distance algorithm to calculate real-time risk probabilities.
* **[Student Management API](https://github.com/imairena/.NET-Core-CRUD-Operations):** Engineered a RESTful API using **ASP.NET Core** and **C#**. Automated the build process by setting up a **Jenkins CI/CD** pipeline.
* **[Staff Check-in Portal](https://github.com/imairena/check-in-portal-showcase):** Designed and deployed a full-stack portal using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Express.js**. Implemented automated notifications via **MongoDB** and **Firebase Auth**.
